The example is inspired by PCB Artist Arduino project (https://pcbartists.com/product-documentation/accurate-esp32-decibel-meter/).

It uses ESP Custom Sensor Component, which will not be supported from ESPHome in the 2025.1.0 release. (https://esphome.io/components/sensor/custom.html)

Just put the decibel_meter.h in the same folder as the .yaml file.
